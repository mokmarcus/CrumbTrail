What was accomplished during the week:
    This week we focused on setting up the foundation for the website. We created an index page and a search for our website. We also began to cork with the google maps api to render a map and have nearby restaurants on it.We also began to research and implement how to add and show routes on a google map. We also found a part of google maps api called blockrouter. that allows us to take the area around a route and block it up to optimize search near the route and we have begun to experiment with how to use it.



Challenges and issues team faced during the week:
    Our largest challenges this week were figuring out how to work with the google maps api that we have not worked with yet. Many members also have had difficult weeks and it was hard to coordinate a time that worked for everyone. 



Your goals for the next week:
    Next week, we plan to have the routing wroking with block routing. We will then use those bloack to find nearby areas for each block. We also plan to continue to do work on the front end and on the login system.
